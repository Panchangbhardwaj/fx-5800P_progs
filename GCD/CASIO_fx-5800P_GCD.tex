%     CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
%     LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
%     ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
%     INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
%     REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
%     PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
%     THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
%     HEREUNDER.
% 
% Statement of Purpose
% 
% The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
% exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
% and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
% authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
% 
% Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
% the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
% scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
% of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
% works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
% and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
% These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
% culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
% works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
% part through the use and efforts of others.
% 
% For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
% expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
% associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
% is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
% elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
% terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
% Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
% 
% 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
% protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
% Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
% limited to, the following:
% 
%   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
%      communicate, and translate a Work;
%  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
% iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
%      likeness depicted in a Work;
%  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
%      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
%   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
%      in a Work;
%  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
%      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
%      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
%      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
%      directive); and
% vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
%      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
%      implementations thereof.
% 
% 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
% of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
% irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
% Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
% of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
% future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
% worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
% treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
% medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
% including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
% purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
% member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
% successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
% revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
% equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
% as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
% 
% 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
% be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
% Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
% account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
% extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
% person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
% irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
% Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
% maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
% time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
% of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
% limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
% "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
% applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
% reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
% partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
% of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
% will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
% Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
% action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
% express Statement of Purpose.
% 
% 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
% 
%  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
%     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
%  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
%     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
%     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
%     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
%     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
%     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
%     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
%  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
%     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
%     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
%     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
%     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
%     Work.
%  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
%     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
%     this CC0 or use of the Work.
